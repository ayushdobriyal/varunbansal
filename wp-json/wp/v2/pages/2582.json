These tattoo removal lasers act on the tattoo ink by utilizing the energy of a coherent beam of light. The laser from a Q switch laser easily passes through normal skin without causing any damage. However, it is absorbed by the tattoo particles. Due to absorption of laser energy the tattoo pigment breaks down into tiny fragments. These fragments are subsequently drained away by the body\u2019s lymphatic system.\r\n            <\/div>\r\n            <div class=\"col-md-12 mb-30 animate-box\" data-animate-effect=\"fadeInUp\">\r\n                <div class=\"section-title\"> <h3>Do I need to see a Dermatologist for tattoo removal?<\/h3> <\/div>\r\n                <p>A consultation with a dermatologist is essential prior to undergoing the procedure.
