During this period 10 ml of your blood is collected and centrifuged at pre-determined settings.  This process of centrifugation separates the other components of the blood from the platelets. The final result is a rich concentrate of platelets and growth factors within the plasma. This concentrate is then injected into the skin using fine needles at the level of the collagen. <\/p>\r\n    \r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <div class=\"section-title\"><h2>How does PRP work for the face?<\/h2><\/div>\r\n    <p>Platelet rich plasma therapy has a high concentration of platelets which leads to formation and release of growth factors that promote collagen regeneration underneath the skin. Due to this new collagen the skin looks healthier and younger. It improves fine lines. Wrinkles and various other signs of skin aging. Works on the texture of the skin and makes it tighter and more supple. When combine with micro needling it is a great treatment for acne scars.<\/p>\r\n    \r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <div class=\"section-title\"><h3>How soon are results of PRP visible?<\/h3><\/div>\r\n<p>    The results develop gradually over a few weeks to months.<\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <div class=\"section-title\"><h3>Is PRP safe?<\/h3><\/div>\r\n<p>    Since the entire procedure is based on utilising your own plasma, it is considered to be the safest anti-aging procedure.<\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    \r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        <div class=\"section-title\"><h3>How many sessions would be needed to see results?<\/h3><\/div>\r\n<p>        A minimum of 3-4 sessions are needed to show results.<\/p>\r\n        \r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        <div class=\"section-title\"><h3>How long to PRP results last?<\/h3><\/div>\r\n<p>        The skin rejuvenation results last for at least 12-18 months.  <\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n        <div class=\"section-title\"><h3>Can PRP be combined with other treatments?<\/h3><\/div>\r\n<p>        Yes, PRP can be combined with your other anti-aging procedures like dermal fillers, botox, threads, photo facials, Clear lift etc.<\/p>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"col-md-12\">\r\n    <div class=\"reservations\">\r\n    <div class=\"butn-dark\"><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/get-appointment\/\"><span>Get appointment<\/span><\/a><\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"icon\"><\/div>\r\n    <div class=\"text\">Call us\r\n    <a href=\"tel:96501 44438\">9667684409<\/a><\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <\/div>\r\n    <\/section>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>What is PRP?
