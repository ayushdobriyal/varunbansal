However, like any other sphere, technology has also revolutionised the landscape of the hair removal industry.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Several of the best dermatology clinics that perform <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/laser-hair-removal-delhi\/\">Laser Hair removal in Delhi<\/a><\/strong> have remarked that this modern noninvasive way of hair removal has become the hallmark of the hair removal industry since it dispenses permanent results with little to no downtime!<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>If you\u2019re looking to get a hair removal treatment, here are four methods you could look into:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Waxing<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you\u2019re looking for a treatment that would leave a long-lasting smoothness behind, then waxing might not be the ideal pick for you.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Waxing often leaves behind rashes, temporary bumps, redness, and irritation. Moreover, since the wax used in it contains a wide range of ingredients, it is possible that an allergic reaction could take place.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence, while waxing sure does work for hair removal, it might also give way to varying side-effects, ranging from sun sensitivity to infections.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Shaving<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Shaving is amongst the most effortless hair removal techniques, as all it asks for is an electric shaver or a safety razor.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, shaving comes with a lot of risks as it involves the possibility of ingrown hairs that can often be painful in sensitive areas. In addition to the prospect of ingrown hairs, shaving might also result in abrasion and razor burn.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Though shaving assists in removing hair from large areas, such as from the legs and underarms, it\u2019s not a permanent solution as it leaves the roots intact, allowing the hair to grow back in little to no time.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Threading<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While threading can be performed easily, there are several skin implications and infections associated with it if it\u2019s not carried out carefully.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Over the past few years, there have been several reported incidents of persistent reddening of the skin and even swelling. Moreover, a single mishap during the procedure could result in a condition known as folliculitis (a bacterial infection that affects hair follicles).<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The applications of threading are limited as it is generally used for unwanted facial hair.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Laser hair removal<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unlike the above-mentioned techniques that provide short-term results, laser hair removal is amongst the few methods that dispense permanent relief from unwanted hair.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the leading clinics that carry out <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/laser-hair-removal\/\">Laser Hair removal in Gurgaon<\/a><\/strong>, a laser hair removal appointment takes only around twenty minutes. Visual results start to show up after two sessions, while permanent and effective results take place after twelve sessions.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Through the laser hair removal method, the dermatologist can selectively target dark, coarse hairs and leave the surrounding skin untouched. Moreover, with each laser pulse taking a fraction of a second to treat several hairs at the same time, the treatment gets concluded within a few minutes.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With speed, precision, and zero downtime, laser hair removal is the most ideal pick for anyone who\u2019s looking to get a hair removal treatment.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hence, when we take a look at the different hair removal methods, we find that laser hair removal is the most effective one. Where waxing, shaving, and threading would be harsh to your skin, laser hair removal would provide faster and long-lasting results without any side effects, getting your money\u2019s worth.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Who doesn\u2019t yearn for silky, smooth skin that is free from unwanted hair?
