We, at <em>Garekars M.D. Dermatology Clinic<\/em>, use a Hyaluronic based product to restore hydration, plumpness, and smoothing of damaged and dull skin. It&#8217;s an over-all micro-injection technique that puts along with hyaluronic acid right into the skin to make it plumper and more even. This is also known as Hydrolifting or Hydrofilling.<\/span>\n\nHere is a step-by-step process of the treatment:\n<ul>\n \t<li>Since it&#8217;s a 90-minute long procedure, it is always good to start with a <strong>soothing head massage<\/strong>. It will help you relax and be prepare for the complete treatment.<\/li>\n \t<li>Using a premium scrub, your <strong>face will be cleansed <\/strong>thoroughly. This will not only clean your face from the makeup but also the clogged impurities and dust on your face.<\/li>\n \t<li>Then comes the <strong>exfoliation process<\/strong> to further prep your skin. The mask used here will suit even sensitive skin.<\/li>\n \t<li>The fourth step involves the <strong>extraction of clogged impurities<\/strong>. This is especially done at the T-zone so that you have a clear forehead and nose. Even though the whole treatment is for brightening your skin, de-clogging the pores will give you better results.<\/li>\n \t<li>To <strong>soothe your skin<\/strong> after extraction, a face mask with cold mist is then applied to prepare the skin for the next steps. If you have sensitive skin, you should definitely not skip this step.<\/li>\n \t<li>A <strong>concentrated serum<\/strong> with active ingredients is applied to your face and let the skin absorb the nutrients quickly. Moreover, the serum is specially curated in a way to ensure rapid absorption.<\/li>\n \t<li>A simple <strong>detoxifying massage<\/strong> is then given to your face\u00a0to improve micro-circulation. This not only enhances the benefits but is also quite soothing for your face.<\/li>\n \t<li>Finally, a <strong>mask with Hyaluronic Acid<\/strong> and Diamond Mica is applied to your face. Your skin absorbs more skincare goodness and helps in deep hydration of your skin. Since the mask is made of refined alginate, it creates a vacuum-like environment over the skin. This aids in the nourishing and hydrating ingredients to go deep into the skin.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">HOW DOES IT HELP?<\/span><\/h3>\nYou might have seen your skin getting dull or rough quite often, and there are several reasons for this. With continuous exposure to pollution, sun, air-conditioner, or using heating appliances, all-cause a decline of hyaluronic acid (a natural component of skin) in your face. This reduces the water-binding capacity which manifests as roughness, fine lines, dullness, and loss of elasticity. With glass skin treatment, you can bring back the lost hyaluronic acid and collagen in your face as it hydrates from within and hence improves the elasticity to rejuvenate the skin in a great manner.\n\n&nbsp;\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">WHAT AREAS CAN BE TREATED?<\/span><\/h3>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With skin boosters, we can very effectively rejuvenate the face, back of hands, decolletage, and neck area of your body.
