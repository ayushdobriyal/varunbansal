Focus on your diet<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Following a balanced diet months before your wedding is vital to get glowing and healthy skin. By eating healthy, your body would clear out all the toxins on its own, allowing your skin to breathe.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You could start by drinking enough water, eating seasonal fruits, avoiding sugary and spicy foods. Also, it is crucial to focus on healthy fats as they help in making the skin look youthful.<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>2. Get enough sleep\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Skin produces new collagen when you are asleep, which makes your skin look younger and brighter. In contrast, lack of sleep would give way to dark circles and fine lines, which obviously won\u2019t look good on your face.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Hence, make sure that you turn in early every day and get your eight hours as it would accelerate the production of collagen and make your face radiant and youthful.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>3. Moisturise twice a day\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It is important to keep your skin hydrated throughout the day, specifically if you are prone to dry skin.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">To get the best results, moisturize twice a day with a moisturizer that suits your skin. Make sure to moisturize your neck and to apply it to your skin in upward strokes as it helps in giving quick and effective results.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>4. Get regular spa and massage sessions\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your skin looks best when you stress less and relax more and what\u2019s more relaxing than regular spa and massage sessions?\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By opting for regular sessions, your tightened muscles would also loosen up, making your skin look better. Hence, spa and massage sessions would play a significant role in making your skin look radiant and relaxed.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>5. Apply homemade packs\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By applying natural homemade packs, your skin would get nourished from deep within. However, it doesn\u2019t mean applying any natural face pack that you can get your hands on.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">First, you\u2019ll have to ensure that you aren\u2019t allergic to any of the ingredients that would be present in the face pack as allergies can cause severe harm to your skin, making it look red and damaged.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>6. Practice meditation\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Stress can take a severe toll on your skin health, making it look dull and dry. If you work under stressful conditions, it is always better to practice meditation.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Meditation would help you stay calm under stressful situations and get rid of anxious thoughts. Ultimately, it would help in keeping your skin healthy!<\/span><\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><b>7. Enhance your liquid consumption\u00a0<\/b><\/h2>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to the <\/span><strong><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">best dermatologists in Gurgaon<\/a><\/strong><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, drinking plenty of water must be the top priority of any skincare regime. Water acts as a natural detoxifier for our body, clearing out all the toxins that can cause acne and other skin conditions.\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apart from water, you must also consume fruits and vegetables that have high water content, such as orange, cucumber, and watermelon.\u00a0\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">By embracing these seven vows, you would indefinitely come up with radiant and glowing skin on your wedding day.
