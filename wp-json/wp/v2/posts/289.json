Where do you go? Do you go\u00a0to a salon or do you visit a <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">cosmetic clinic<\/a>?\n\nYou need to think long and hard before you make that choice as the decisions that you take can\u00a0change the course of your life. And why is that?\n\nIn this post, we will try to make sure that we tell you what the benefits of getting Laser hair\u00a0reduction over waxing are.\n\n1. Laser hair removal does not get rid of all the hair immediately.\n\nAnd you can\u2019t wax during the entire process, so if you want to start the process right now, you\u00a0should consider shaving or going au natural for some time. But as long as it is just the last time\u00a0in forever, isn\u2019t it worth it?\n\n2. It is a one-time investment\n\nYes, laser hair removal can seem like a big investment initially. But do remember, it is only a\u00a0one time investment. And like all one time investment it will pay itself off not only in financial, but\u00a0also in terms of convenience and efficiency.\u00a0Seriously, think of the time, effort and energy that you save when you don\u2019t have to go to the\u00a0salon\/beauty parlor for waxing, ever!\u00a0This fact alone makes it worth the investment.\n\n3.\u00a0It is really quick\n\nYup, you heard that right; laser hair removal will take considerably lesser time when compared\u00a0to you fortnightly waxing sessions at the salon. The sessions (although you need more than a\u00a0few) will typically last no longer than your average lunch break.\n\n4. It doesn\u2019t hurt as much as waxing\n\nAll the concerns about laser hair removal being a painful process are just a hoax people; the\u00a0process hurts no more than waxing does. In fact, you can always go for a topical anaesthetic if\u00a0you feel sensitive in the process.\n\n5. You get silky smooth skin\n\nNo compromises, no stubble, no oops-we- missed-that- bunch approach. Laser hair removal\u00a0leaves your skin feeling perfect and flawlessly hair free. With technological advances in the field,\u00a0we now have lasers that suit all skin types and deliver perfect results consistently.\n\n6. You never have to worry about the aftermath\n\nWaxing has its fair share of problems, be that discomfort of the increased risk of infections\u00a0because of unsanitary methods used. But laser hair removal is always carried out in sterilised\u00a0zones at clinics following the best practices and protocols.\n\nHaving read all of this, three things should be very clear to the reader about laser hair removal.\n\n1. The permanence of it.\n2. The long term savings that you get.\n3. That it is a painful process is a misconception\n\nJust head on over to our <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/laser-hair-removal\/\">laser hair removal page<\/a> to explore all possibilities.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>It is a great dilemma when you want to lose your unwanted hair.
