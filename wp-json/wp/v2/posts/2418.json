While basic moisturization and cleansing work for a few people, it is not enough to nourish the skin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the top <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">skin specialists in Gurgaon<\/a><\/strong>, today, our skin needs more attention than ever. Taking into account the chemicals our skin gets exposed to every day you need a holistic skincare routine that is specifically tailored for your requirements.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Here is where dermatologists come into the picture- not only do they provide expert advice, but they also recommend the best solutions for skin problems. If you\u2019re in a dilemma about whether you should visit a dermatologist or not, here are four reasons that prove why it\u2019s the best decision:<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">1. Dermatologists can obliterate acne scars<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You could get rid of acne through homemade remedies, but what about the scars these little buggers leave behind?<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">With years of experience in treating these scars, dermatologists specialize in procedures through which they can remove acne scars in little to no time. From laser skin resurfacing to microdermabrasion, dermatologists can use several procedures to help you get scar-free skin.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Moreover, consulting a dermatologist for acne scars gives an added benefit of regular follow-ups, which ensures that your skin remains both healthy and acne-free after the treatment.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">2. Dermatologists can remove moles<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Whether you have a mole which is present since birth or it has popped up in recent times, it is crucial to get it examined every year by a dermatologist.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Regular check-ups become more important if the size, shape, or color of the mole begins to change or if the moles become too itchy or painful. It is because irregular moles that are different from the normal ones have a higher chance to become cancerous.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dermatologists not only help in removing moles but also help in making sure that there isn\u2019t any underlying condition.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">3. Dermatologists can effectively treat psoriasis<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Psoriasis refers to an autoimmune disorder under which the immune system orders the skin cells to grow too quickly. It results in the skin cells to pile up on one another, causing thick and red scales.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Now, psoriasis is a chronic disease which means it has no cure. However, dermatologists can significantly help in curbing its symptoms, so much so that after a time, it becomes virtually non-existent.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Dermatologists would create a tailored medication treatment plan for you, consisting of both ointments and creams, that would help in effectively treating psoriasis.<\/p>\n\n<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">4. Dermatologists give a complete skin evaluation<\/h2>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When you visit a dermatologist, he\/she would inspect your skin from head to toe. From looking out for moles that are irregular in nature to checking out your hair and nails for any potential medical conditions, dermatologists make sure that your skin is free from any condition.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In case a skin condition is identified, dermatologists follow a systematic procedure of diagnostics, identification, and treatment. They give a complete skin report and recommend treatment options to cure the ailment from the roots. Hence, dermatologists give you a complete picture of your skin health.<\/p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These are just a few of the reasons why a dermatologist must be your go-to option to get the best solution for any skin problems. Most of the leading skin specialists in Gurgaon recommend seeing a dermatologist at least once a year to ensure that your skin is in a healthy condition. With years of experience behind them, dermatologists provide customized treatments to give the best results.<\/p>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Due to the hustle and bustle of our daily lives, most of us fail to follow a healthy skincare routine.
