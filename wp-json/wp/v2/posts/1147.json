Work out<\/h2>\nThis is a corollary to the first point on this list; working out regularly (especially cardio) will help get your juices flowing.\n\nNot only has working out been linked to a boost in blood circulation, but it also has a positive effect on your mood, this effect s because when you work out, your body releases endorphins, which are your body\u2019s own feel-good hormones.\n<h2>3.
