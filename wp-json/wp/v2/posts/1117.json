And we offer some of the best treatments for wrinkle reduction. Today we will talk to you about Botox, the treatment that is all the rage in India for treatment for wrinkles, fine lines and ageing skin.\n\nWrinkles are creases, folds or ridges in the skin. They are a normal occurrence when you get older. But there are a lot of factors which can accelerate their appearance. Sun Damage (UV light in sun rays breaks down skin collagen- the matrix that your skin is built on), Dehydration and habits like smoking (reduces blood supply to the skin) and excessive\/ binge drinking (dehydrates the skin) ensure that you get your wrinkles early in life.\n\nNormally, as you get older, your skin gets drier, thinner, and less able to protect itself from sun damage which leads to the appearance of wrinkles. It is natural process as inevitable as ageing itself.\n\nWrinkles are not well received by people (primarily because they make it easier for people to guess you age), which makes preventing and treating wrinkles a multi-billion dollar industry globally.\n\nThere are two types of wrinkles- surface lines and deep furrows.\n\nSo, what are my options?\n\nThere are treatments out there that claim to have great results but have no effect, while others (like botox) have shown to have significant effect on treatment of wrinkles.\n\nBotox is short for Botulinum toxin and is actually a neurotoxic protein produced by the bacteria Clostridium Botulinum. While the toxin finds medical uses in treating various muscle spastic disorders and nerve disorders, its major role is in cosmetic treatments for wrinkles.\n\nInjections of the toxin into muscles under the facial wrinkles will help relax those muscles by paralysing them temporarily by blocking the signal from nerves to muscles.\n\nHere is what you can expect when you decide to get a Botox treatment done.\n\n<strong>1. It is a pain free procedure<\/strong>\n\nSure, there are Multiple injections involved, but when you compare it with other treatment options for wrinkles, this is a relatively pain free procedure. Moreover, for anxious patients the option of applying a skin numbing cream is also available. This makes the procedure absolutely pain free.\n\n<strong>2. Your facial muscles are not completely \u201cparalysed\u201d<\/strong>\n\nThe word paralyses is used to imply a state of relaxation of the muscles, Muscles gain their normal functionality within a week or two (varies from person to person). In the hands of an experienced dermatologist the muscles would be just relaxed enough to make the wrinkles disappear and the expressions of the face would still be retained.\n\n<strong>3. The results are not immediate<\/strong>\n\nPeople believe Botox to be magic, and expect results immediately after the injections. This is not true the results take anywhere between 4-7 (again- varies).\n\n<strong>4. But they are long lasting (considerably)<\/strong>\n\nThe results, however, are long lasting. A single sitting of Botox can relieve you up for up to 4- 6 months from wrinkles and fine lines.\n\n<strong>5. Botox is not a permanent solution for wrinkles<\/strong>\n\nYet, Botox is not a permanent solution for wrinkles and you will probably need to get the treatment once every 6-7 months as wrinkles will be back to their normal form after the treatment wears off. However re-treatment is not mandatory. A lot of our clients get botox done only for a special occasion and do not repeat it thereafter.\n\n<strong>6. And it is most definitely, not risky.<\/strong>\n\nBotox is not risky when administered by a trained medical professional; you just need to ensure that the clinic that you get yours at has the specialization and experience needed to administer the treatment.\n\n<strong>7. Preventive Botox. Yes, that\u2019s a thing too-<\/strong>\n\nPeople as young as 24 can consider getting Botox treatment if they experience signs of skin ageing prematurely. Getting preventive Botox treatment will offset any chance of having full blown wrinkles.\n\nSome other treatment options (apart from Botox) for wrinkles are-\n\n<strong>1. Medication<\/strong>\n\nTopical Retinoids that are derived from Vitamin A are said to reduce fine lines before they turn into wrinkles.\n\n<strong>2. Cosmetic Surgery<\/strong>\n\nA host of surgical operations are available for treatment of wrinkles.\n\n<strong>3. Dermabrasion<\/strong>\n\nThis process uses controlled wearing of the upper layers of skin with sandpaper or other mechanical means.\n\n<strong>4. Chemical Peels<\/strong>\n\nInvolves applying a chemical solution to wrinkly areas and will remove the sagging end of the skin.\n\n<strong>5. Facelift<\/strong>\n\nThese are surgical procedures that take considerable time to heal and are not without complications but will last for up to 5 and half years.\n\n<strong>6. Fillers<\/strong>\n\nFillers are materials that are filled in the dermis of your skin and will help you get tighter younger skin.\n\n<strong>7. Laser Therapy<\/strong>\n\nLaser therapy will heat the dermis of the skin and will stimulate the development of new collagen fibers.\n\nFor the best Botox therapy and consultation regarding the treatments that are the best suited for your skin, trust only <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">Garekars M.D Skin Clinic<\/a>, <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/botox-treatment\/\">the best Botox Clinic<\/a> in DLF Phase 1, Gurgaon.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We are Garekars MD skin clinic, the best skin clinic in DLF Phase 1, Gurgaon for wrinkle treatment.
