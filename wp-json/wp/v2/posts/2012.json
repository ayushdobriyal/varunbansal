This treatment can work in two ways. It can either remove the outer layer of the skin\u2019s surface, or it can stimulate new cells that cover the damaged cells. <strong>Acne scar removal treatments<\/strong> are generally quite versatile as they can also be used to reduce the appearance of age spots, warts, wrinkles, keloids, and scars. It can also be used to target certain types of burn marks and injury-related scars.\n<h2>What to expect during <strong>acne scar removal treatments?<\/strong><\/h2>\nLaser treatments for acne scars are considered outpatient treatments, which means that you can go home once the procedure is over. It does not require a long recuperation period either; it takes 3-10 days for the skin to look healed.\n\nDuring the procedure, the doctor will use a topical anesthetic. However, if patients are too anxious, or if the procedure is too vast, the doctor may recommend sedation. Once that is done, the dermatologist will use focused beams of light (that come from a laser wand) to repeatedly target the affected area.\n\nWhen it comes to laser treatment for acne scars, side effects include swelling, temporary oozing, pain, and\/or redness. Furthermore, if you suffer from light sensitivity (or are taking medications that lead to light sensitivity), your doctor will advise you not to get the procedure done. Doctors often discourage heart patients who take blood-thinning medication from seeking this treatment too.\n<h2>What are the types of <strong>acne scar removal treatments<\/strong>?<\/h2>\nBased on your scars, your doctor may recommend any of the following types of <strong>acne scar removal treatments:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li><strong>Resurfacing<\/strong>: In this treatment, the laser removes the outer layer of the skin.<\/li>\n \t<li><strong>Fractionated laser resurfacing<\/strong>: In this treatment, the laser penetrates deeper into the skin and stimulates the production of collagen. This is usually recommended for very dark scars.<\/li>\n \t<li><strong>Non-ablative laser resurfacing<\/strong>: In this treatment, doctors use an infrared laser to penetrate deeper into the inner layers of skin. Like fractioned laser resurfacing, this also stimulates collagen and helps new cells cover the damaged ones.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2>Conclusion<\/h2>\nMany people hate the appearance of acne scars and often resort to heavy, cakey makeup to hide them.
