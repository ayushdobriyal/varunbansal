Just ask anybody who suffers from constant skin problems like acne, white and blackheads and oily skin and they will tell you of the hundreds of things that they do every day and the thousands of sacrifices they make every day to keep their skin healthy.\n\nSkin problems affect men and women both, causing image issues and distress to the people who are affected.
