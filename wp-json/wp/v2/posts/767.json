Here, is the solution.\n\n<a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/facials\/\">Medical facials<\/a> are the thing right now and why they are gaining popularity over conventional facials is a question that we will answer in this post.\n\nYou can get a medical facial from a licensed medical aesthetician or a dermatologist.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-1985\" src=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/benefits-of-a-medical-facial.jpg\" alt=\"benefits of a medical facial\" width=\"2716\" height=\"1810\" \/>\n\nMedical facials are better than conventional cosmetic facials because-\n\n<strong>1. They reach deeper<\/strong>\n\nYour skin the largest organ system that you have and what you get to see is just the top layer.\n\nSkin that glows with health can only ever be achieved from the inside. Which is why\u00a0medical facials help you get that effect from the inside vis-\u00e0-vis from the top layer down as conventional facials do.\n\n<strong>2. They are customized to your skin<\/strong>\n\nYou go to a spa and they have a variety of facials that they offer and even after the variety that they offer none of them are customized to your particular skin type like a medical facial is.\n\nWhen you visit your dermatologist for a medical facial, the first thing that you receive is a thorough skin examination that will help them identify your skin type and texture. What you get as a result\u00a0is a facial that is as personal as the skin that you have.\n\n<strong>3. Work on a cellular level<\/strong>\n\nYour skin takes approximately 3-4 weeks to shed completely. A medical facial will help accelerate the process and get you the glowing, healthy skin, instantly.\n<h2>7 Amazing Benefits Of A Medical Facial over Spa Facial<\/h2>\n<strong>1. Deep cleansing<\/strong>\n\nJust like at a salon, it all begins with a cleansing therapy for your skin. When your skin is cleansed is when its real texture is visible.\n\nAnd only then can we proceed to the next step.\n\n<strong>2. Complete skin analysis<\/strong>\n\nNow, this is something that you will never get at a salon\u00a0because they do not have the innate understanding of skin from the medical perspective.\n\nOnce we have determined the texture of your skin, its pH levels and the nature of your skin, we proceed to the next step.\n\n<strong>3. Exfoliation<\/strong>\n\nYou can get either microdermabrasion or a chemical peel, either way, the results are the same. Your skin is now more receptive to the active ingredients used in the process.\n\n<strong>4. Steam<\/strong>\n\nSteam helps clear pores and softens debris that has been accumulating inside. Steam also helps boost circulation.\n\n<strong>5. Healthy circulation<\/strong>\n\nMassage is then done with all the active ingredients in place. This helps get rid of the toxins and promotes circulation of healthy blood which will leave skin looking young and healthy.\n\n<strong>6. Deep hydration and sun protection<\/strong>\n\nMoisturizers are then allowed to seep in via a suitable face mask and SPF factors are also added.\n\n<strong>7. Healthy and glowing skin<\/strong>\n\nThe end result is always the same, healthy glowing skin. This works best if you get the procedure done every 4-5 weeks.\n\nIf you are looking for the best clinic for a medical facial in Gurgaon, then visit us at\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">Garekars M.D. Dermatology<\/a>\u00a0&amp; Aesthetics clinic &amp; consult with our experienced dermatologists.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Facials are a\u00a0\u00a0great way of pampering your skin but when we talk about facials we always face a dilemma which one is better medical facial vs spa or cosmetic facial.
