It is regarded as a procedure which probably is restricted to celebrities. However, the facts reveal a different story altogether.\n\nBotox is one of the most common cosmetic procedures being done in the United States. Botox continues to gain popularity in our country as well and every year the number of procedures being done have shown a rising trend.\n\nThis blog is aimed at providing you with a basic information about Botox and what to expect when u do decide to get it done.\n<h2>What is Botox?<\/h2>\nBotox is purified botulinum toxin, derived from a bacteria, Clostridium botulinum.\n<h2>How does it work?<\/h2>\nIt blocks the release of a nerve transmitter (acetylcholine) and in turn, relaxes muscles. As a result, it can smooth hyper-functional lines and change the contour of the face and neck.\n<h2>Do I need it?<\/h2>\nBotox is the only approved treatment to temporarily improve the appearance of both moderate to severe frown lines between the brows and crow\u2019s feet lines around the eyes in adults. It can make these lines disappear or minimize them depending on the injection technique. The overall effect is that of a smooth and rejuvenated face.\n<h2>How long does the procedure take?<\/h2>\nPost a thorough consultation, the procedure itself takes just 15 mins. In addition, there is no downtime making it an ideal lunch time procedure.\n<h2>How soon can I see the effects?<\/h2>\nThe effects begin to set in after 4-7 days. The full effect is observed after two weeks and it is at this time that a follow-up visit is planned.\n<h2>How long does the effect last?<\/h2>\nThe effect is not permanent and lasts for around 4-6 months.\n<h2>Is my face going to be worse when the effect wears off?<\/h2>\nYour wrinkles and lines would go back to the way they were earlier. There is no worsening of the lines and it is not a necessity that you repeat the procedure.\n<h2>Would I have a mask like face?<\/h2>\nIn our country, unlike the western world, we prefer to preserve\u00a0a bit of expression lines. Accordingly, the dosages injected are minimal and a mask like face is avoided.\n<h2>Are there any side effects?<\/h2>\nSide effects are very rare and transient. In a few cases, minimal bruising can occur which lasts for around 4-7 days.\n\nSo in case you are contemplating going for this therapy, we sincerely hope that this post has addressed a few issues.\n\nFor a full consultation regarding Botox, feel free to <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/contact-us\/\" class=\"broken_link\">contact us<\/a><\/strong>.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everyone, we are the Garekars MD, and we like to keep posting about topics which we feel are relevant to present day dermatology\/cosmetology in Gurgaon.
