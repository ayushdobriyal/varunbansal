And it is never a great experience.\n\nWhich is why, we, Garekars M.D Skin Clinic, one of the best skin clinic in DLF phase 1, Gurgaon will be talking about wrinkles today.\n\nThere are things that you can do for wrinkles at home. There are ways that you can avoid the onset of wrinkles in the first place and even treatments that you can seek\u00a0at your dermatologist.\n\nLet\u2019s talk about all of that today.\n<h2>At home<\/h2>\nThese are some simple things that you can do at home to reduce the appearance of wrinkles.\n\n<strong>1. Olive Oil<\/strong>\n\nOlive oil hydrates your skin like few things can. Use this at night.Massage a few drops on your face at night and rinse off in the morning.You will wake up to a\u00a0noticeably soft and supple skin in the morning.\n\nOlive oil is also a rich source of Vitamin B and D groups and also contains Oleic acid and Polyphenol which are great for your skin.\n\n<strong>2. Egg Whites<\/strong>\n\nEgg whites are a rich source of Vitamin E, separate the yellow from the eggs and\u00a0whip the whites and apply to your face. Leave for 15 minutes and rinse off.\n\nVitamin E quenches something called free radicals from your body, free radicals cause oxidative damage not just to your skin, but also to all other systems in your body.\n\nYou can also consider using Vitamin E oil for your skin.\n\n<strong>3. Eat right<\/strong>\n\nEating lots of veggies and fruits that are high in mineral content, have lots of\u00a0Vitamins and have a lot of dietary fiber is great for your skin.\n\nA well balanced diet will make sure that your skin gets all the nutrients that it needs and that they get absorbed by your GIT.\n<h2>To prevent the onset of early fine lines and wrinkles<\/h2>\n<strong>1. Avoid stress<\/strong>\n\nStress has been known to play an important role in progression of skin ageing. The\u00a0best way that you can prevent wrinkles is to avoid taking undue stress.\n\nThe way that this happens is when you take stress, cortisol (a stress hormone) levels increase, flooding your body. Cortisol degrades collagen, leading to loose skin that later gains a wrinkled appearance.\n\n<strong>2. Don\u2019t smoke<\/strong>\n\nSmoking is the number one environmental factor that will cause premature ageing of the skin. The smoke from cigarettes affects you on multiple levels, smoking\u00a0causes constriction and blockage of micro vessels that supply your skin\u00a0healthy, oxygenated blood, thus depriving your skin of the much needed oxygen\u00a0and nutrients that it needs to repair itself and stay healthy.\n\n<strong>3. Stay Hydrated<\/strong>\n\nStaying hydrated at all times is going to help your skin retain its natural collagen\u00a0and will help boost radiance and glow.\n\nDrinking enough water throughout the day will lead to better elimination of waste products from your body.\n\nThese waste products would have otherwise caused damage to your skin that is irreparable and unhealthy.\n\n<strong>4. Use the right products<\/strong>\n\nSun exposure is another very important cause of premature ageing; use the right,\u00a0non-toxic sunscreens to get the best protection for your skin.\n\nProducts with methyl paraben, for example do more harm to your skin than good. We recommend that you use a sunscreen that is paraben free, even if on the slightly pricy side.\n\nAdditionally, you can go for an in clinic treatment\n\nBotox is a very effective in clinic treatment that is popular because it has fast\u00a0results and is safe when delivered by an experienced clinician.\n\nMesotherapy is yet another in clinic treatment that will help reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles.\n\nYou might even just need prescription medications if your wrinkles are caused by some other underlying cause.\n\n<em><strong>Consider getting a consultation at <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">Garekars M.D Skin Clinic<\/a> to find the best options for you.<\/strong><\/em>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Wrinkles, especially premature wrinkles can cause you to look more than just a wee bit older than you actually are.
