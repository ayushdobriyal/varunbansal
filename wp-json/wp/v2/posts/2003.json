The crisp, cold winter air can leave your skin feeling rough and tight. Hot water baths \u2013 a necessity in the winter season \u2013 can also dry out your skin, strip away the natural oils, and leave it dying for hydration. Even sitting in a heated room adds to the overall dryness of your skin. This is why you must take extra precautions as the weather grows chillier. Follow these <strong>winter skin care tips<\/strong> for glowing, healthy skin:\n<h2>1.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Invest in the perfect cleanser<\/h2>\nSkin care begins with the way you clean it. According to <a href=\"https:\/\/in.linkedin.com\/in\/gurveen-waraich-90b70891\">Dr. Gurveen Waraich Garekar<\/a>, using cleansers that promise to hydrate your skin is the perfect way to build a <strong>winter skin care routine<\/strong> that will truly do wonders for your skin. Aloe vera cleaners can not only help you hydrate your skin, but also remove dead skin cells and aid with cell regeneration. As a result, your skin will look fresh, healthy, and hydrated throughout the winter season.\n<h2>2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use makeup that aligns with your needs<\/h2>\nIf you are a makeup-lover, there\u2019s a high chance you don\u2019t want to leave home without a full face of makeup. Whether you love the subtle natural look or go for glam all the way, you must use makeup products that make sense for your skin (and the weather!). Even if you have oily skin, using a matte foundation in the winter will harm your skin. This is because matte foundations keep your skin dry, which is the last thing you need during the winter. Use a foundation that offers a dewy finish (or a mix of matte and dewy if that does not work for you). Moreover, using setting powders to seal your look can also lead to dry skin in the winter season. Finally, if you always reach for a liquid lipstick, before to use Vaseline first to avoid cracked lips.\n<h2>3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Add retinol to your nightly <strong>winter skin care routine<\/strong><\/h2>\nRetinol has vitamin A in it, which is great for your skin as it promotes cell regeneration and health. Before going to bed, use retinol to moisturize your face. You can even combine retinol with a regular moisturizer if your skin is very dry.\n<h2>4.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Use natural, organic products<\/h2>\nUsing natural, organic products can benefit the health of your skin in many ways. In the winter, using such products can be especially good for you as they do not contain any alcohol in them. Alcohol tends to dry out the skin and that can be terrible in the winter season. This is one of the most effective <strong>winter face care tips<\/strong> that you can use because it calls for no additional effort on your part. Furthermore, you should also consider using essential oils to hydrate your skin. Remember to choose an oil that works best with your skin type.\n<h2>5.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 One of the most essential <strong>winter skin care tips: <\/strong>Do not forget sunscreen!<\/h2>\nDismissing the importance of sunscreen in the winter is a common mistake people make. Winter may be cold, but it does not mean that the sun has stopped existing. If you want flawless skin that ages well, you must continue to use sunscreen at least ten minutes before you leave your house.\n<h2>6.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Enjoy an Anti-oxidant rich diet!<\/h2>\nIf you\u2019re wondering about <strong>home remedies for glowing skin in winter<\/strong>, one of the best things that you can do for your skin (and your taste buds) is stock your fridge full of berries.
