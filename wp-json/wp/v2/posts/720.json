This blog post is for people who have atopic dermatitis (eczema) and parents of a child\/ baby with atopic dermatitis. Atopic Dermatitis is a distressing disease for the parents and like any other Paediatric Dermatologist in Gurgaon, we frequently spend a lot of time consulting them about daily do\u2019s and don\u2019ts. Here we highlight a few things you should be doing for your little one, in order to minimize flares of the disease.\n\n<strong>The guiding principle:<\/strong>\n\nThe most crucial aspect of Atopic Dermatitis is the preservation of skin moisture. It is only through the maintenance of this moisture that we can break the itch-scratch cycle.\n\n<img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"size-full wp-image-724 aligncenter\" src=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2016\/08\/ITCH-SRATCH-CYCLE.jpg\" alt=\"ITCH-SRATCH CYCLE\" width=\"500\" height=\"500\" \/>\n\n<strong>General care:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Use cotton clothes, avoid synthetic materials and especially wool.<\/li>\n \t<li>In winters, the first layer has to be cotton and then a woollen, to avoid direct contact with wool.<\/li>\n \t<li>Keep child\u2019s fingernails filed short.<\/li>\n \t<li>Use regular laundry detergent, but rinse and clean well. No bleach or fabric softener.<\/li>\n \t<li>Wash new clothes before wearing them to remove irritating dyes and fabric finishers.<\/li>\n \t<li>Avoid drying laundry outside during the pollination season.<\/li>\n \t<li>Do not overheat the bedroom.<\/li>\n \t<li>Air the room out in all seasons.<\/li>\n \t<li>Avoid dust, animal hair etc.<\/li>\n \t<li>No tobacco smoke.<\/li>\n \t<li>Writing a diary to note any triggers that cause flare-ups.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Bathing:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Water temperature between 32\u00b0 and 34\u00b0 (lukewarm).<\/li>\n \t<li>Showers are better. A short duration five-minute shower every day.<\/li>\n \t<li>Turn the water off when washing.<\/li>\n \t<li>For those who like baths and for children: add a liquid emollient to the bath to neutralize water hardness. 5-10 minutes at most to minimise the contact time with the municipal water.<\/li>\n \t<li>Wash with soap-free products (dermatologist recommended) as the pH is closest to that of the skin and does not aggravate skin dryness.<\/li>\n \t<li>Wash hair with dermatological shampoos that are soft or intended for frequent use.<\/li>\n \t<li>Dry by patting, as rubbing reactivates itching. Leave the body wet after bathing.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>Moisturization in atopic dermatitis:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>5-minute, lukewarm baths followed by the application of a moisturizer. (Dermatologist recommended).<\/li>\n \t<li>Keep the moisturizer in the bathroom and apply all over the body while wet, to seal in moisture and allow water to be absorbed through the skin.<\/li>\n \t<li>Moisturize 2-3 times a day.<\/li>\n \t<li>Wash your hands before applying a moisturiser.<\/li>\n \t<li>Apply a liberal amount of the moisturizer, warming it first between your hands, and apply in large circular movements. (Massage)<\/li>\n \t<li>Do not apply an emollient on raw\/ red skin<\/li>\n \t<li>Do not rub the skin<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>When to contact a Dermatologist:<\/strong>\n<ul>\n \t<li>Condition not responding to moisturizers<\/li>\n \t<li>Symptoms continue to worsen<\/li>\n \t<li>There are signs of infection fever, redness, or pain).<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<strong>In case of further queries contact us Garekars M.D. Dermatology and Aesthetics Clinic, Gurgaon at <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\">garekarsmdskinclinic.com<\/a>.<\/strong>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Hi everyone.
