You could always shave, but that is a temporary solution that will leave your hair coming back harder and pricklier than before.\n\nYou could also try depilatory creams; these are the over the counter creams that are painless and easy to use, they are, however, not without side effects. These creams work by melting away your hair.\n\nCreams have common side effects like-\n\n<strong>1. Skin irritation<\/strong>\n\nSkin irritation is one of the first few side effects of chemical hair removal that you notice.\n\n<strong>2. Chemical Burns<\/strong>\n\nLeave these creams on for longer than the time prescribed and you will end up with chemical burns.\n\n<strong>3. Allergic Reactions<\/strong>\n\nThe creams that you get from the market are universal and you never know what they might contain that you might be allergic to.\n\n<strong>4. Lingering Smell<\/strong>\n\nMost depilatory creams will also leave a strong chemical smell that is enough to annoy you.\n\nYou can also get waxing done, but the procedure is painful and requires repeat visits. There are also epilators which work by engaging hair and pulling the from the roots, while this product has its benefits (can also engage ingrown hair and fine hair) it is also not without side effects, some common side effects of using epilators are skin burns, irritation, and rashes.\n\nHere is why <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/laser-hair-removal\/\">laser hair removal<\/a> is more effective than all of the methods mentioned above.\n\n<strong>1. Uses no harsh chemicals<\/strong>\n\nLaser hair removal uses no harsh chemicals on your skin. Lasers work by beaming highly concentrated light into your follicles where the pigments absorb this light and the hair is destroyed.\n\nUnlike depilatory creams, the light source has no unwanted side effects on your skin.\n\n<strong>2. No physical force used<\/strong>\n\nEpilators, waxing, and tweezing use physical force that is applied on your hair, the result is a traumatic exfoliation of hair, and where there is trauma there is definitely going to be the four cardinal signs of inflammation- redness, pain, heat, and swelling.\n\nInflammation is not just uncomfortable; it also leaves your skin hypersensitive and might cause further infections.\n\n<strong>3. It is precise<\/strong>\n\nWith lasers, you can target particular areas with high precision. Lasers selectively target dark, coarse hair while leaving the surrounding skin unaffected.\n\n<strong>4. It is fast<\/strong>\n\nAnother advantage of getting laser hair removal done is that it is fast.\n\nHow fast? Well, each pulse of the laser that has the capacity to remove many hairs (the area the size of a coin) takes only a second.\n\n<strong>5. Predictable outcome<\/strong>\n\nAll the other ways of hair removal mentioned in this post can be performed either at home or by a clinic.\n\nNone of these places have the kind of scientific insight that a dermatologist\/ cosmetologist has about skin and hair.\n\nThe only real way that you can be sure of the outcome of an event is by making sure that all possible outcomes are evaluated scientifically.\n\nLaser hair removal is a process that has been scientifically evaluated to be highly successful and effective with long term results.\n\n<strong>6. Virtually painless<\/strong>\n\nThe process is also virtually painless when compared to other ways that involve either application of force on hair follicles or application of harsh chemicals on your skin, as a result, the procedure has a better outcome when compared to other methods and is pain-free.\n\n<strong>7. Fewer side effects<\/strong>\n\nSide effects of laser hair removal include mild follicular edema that is very easily manageable with right medication and treatment.\n\n<strong>8. No risk of infections<\/strong>\n\nWhen you visit a salon for waxing or threading or tweezing, you are getting all these services that are frequented by all kinds of people that are serviced in the same chairs that you will sit on.\n\nThe fact is no salon follows sterilization protocol the way a doctor would. When you get laser hair removal treatment at your dermatologists you can rest assured that all the best precautions regarding infection control are in place. This mitigates the chance of cross contamination and post-procedure infection.\n\n<strong>9. One time investment<\/strong>\n\nWhen you get hair removal done via conventional methods you end up spending way more than you would for a laser hair treatment seeing as you will need to invest in the procedure just once vis-\u00e0-vis regularly\/ frequently.\n\nWhen you want the <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/laser-hair-removal\/\">best laser hair removal in Gurgaon<\/a>, find your way to the best clinic for laser hair removal.\n\nAt <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">Garekars M.D Skin Clinic,<\/a> we make sure that we follow only the best protocol for all our services.","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When it comes to unwanted body hair, there is more than one way that you can go about dealing with the problem.
