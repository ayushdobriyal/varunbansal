Thankfully, you get a tattoo that you regret later on, you can always get it lasered off. Here\u2019s something that not a lot of people know: even when you\u2019re planning to get a cover-up tattoo, you still have to <\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">go through the process of <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/tattoo-removal-gurgaon\/\" class=\"broken_link\">laser tattoo removal<\/a><\/span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> so that the ink is faded sufficiently enough for the artist to draw something new over it. Whether you\u2019re planning to get a tattoo removed completely, or want to cover one up, you must ensure that you take care of it well after the laser process.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here\u2019s everything you need to know about a faster recovery after tattoo removal:<\/span>\n<h1><strong>How does tattoo removal work?<\/strong><\/h1>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">During the tattoo removal process, a laser light is applied onto the tattoo in order to fade the ink. As a part of this process, the laser light is absorbed by the ink, which then breaks down into tiny molecules. These are then ejected from the body via the digestive system. As this is a slow-paced process, you can expect multiple laser sessions before the tattoo completely fades. You must also maintain a gap of eight weeks between each session. Depending on how large and detailed the tattoo is, it can take anywhere between 2-3 months for it to fade properly.<\/span>\n<h2><strong>Are there any side effects of tattoo removal?<\/strong><\/h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As is the case with most medical procedures, there are certain side effects that you can expect after a laser session. These include:<\/span>\n<ul>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Blistering<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: if you generally get blisters after sun exposure or sunburns, then there are chances of getting blisters when you get laser tattoo removal. Whatever you do, don\u2019t pop the blister! This can result in an infection!<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Swelling<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Just like your skin and muscles swelled a little after getting the tattoo, you can expect a little bit of swelling to occur after you get the laser procedure. This is normal. However, if it doesn\u2019t go away in a few days, then you might want to consult with your dermatologist.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Redness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: Your skin can also become a little red after the laser procedure. Like the swelling, this is to be expected, but you must contact your doctor immediately if it doesn\u2019t go away on its own in a few days.<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Itchiness<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You might experience a little bit of itchiness after the treatment.<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Infections<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you develop an injection on the tattooed area after the procedure, you must contact your doctor. Signs of an infection include redness, swelling, and pus-like discharge. You may even feel discomfort and pain, and might also develop a fever in response to the infection.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Crusting and scabbing<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: You might confuse this for an infection, but don\u2019t worry because the crusting and scabbing are quite normal. Just don\u2019t pick the scabs because that can lead to scarring or even infections if the wound starts to bleed.<\/span><\/li>\n \t<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><b>Allergies<\/b><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">: If you\u2019re allergic to laser treatments, your body will respond by developing hives almost immediately. In such cases, we\u2019ll diagnose the issue on the spot and offer the medical care you need.\u00a0<\/span><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<h2><strong>Aftercare tips you should know of:<\/strong><\/h2>\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After getting the laser treatment, we recommend that you keep the area clean and free from exposure to sun and heat. This will ensure that the skin heals correctly and does not burn due to exposure to the sun. You can opt to wear full-sleeved clothing if the tattoo is on your arm to prevent sun exposure. Finally, icing the area or using topical ointments to soothe itching is also recommended based on your case.\u00a0<\/span>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Do you have a tattoo that you deeply regret? <\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get in touch with us<\/span><\/a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and we\u2019ll laser it off for you!<\/span>","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>We all make mistakes, but no one wants to see evidence of the same printed on their bodies!
