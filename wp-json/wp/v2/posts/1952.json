With the right kinds of products and treatments, you can wake up with soft, naturally glowing skin that looks as healthy as it feels. While the idea of establishing a nighttime skincare routine can be daunting \u2013 after all, who needs another list of tasks to get through? \u2013 It is actually very simple to follow. Here is a simple routine that you can set for yourself (along with variations for skin types at the appropriate stages):\n<h2>Step 1: Cleansing<\/h2>\nIt does not matter what skin type you have \u2013 you must cleanse your face before bed. Your skin is your largest organ and is exposed to dust, grime, and pollution on a daily basis. Cleaning impurities that have settled right under your skin or into your pores are the first step to any skincare routine. You can use a mild cleanser like Cetaphil, or a stronger one, depending on your needs and how much makeup you use. Once you have cleaned your face, wipe off the water and get ready for step 2.\n<h2>Step 2: Scrubbing<\/h2>\nScrubbing or exfoliating your face is the sister step to cleansing. It helps to take away dead skin cells and stubborn dirt from your skin and really primes the base of your skin for the rest of the routine. You can choose to exfoliate your skin a few times a week, or every day, depending not only on your needs but also on the kind of facial scrub you use. Mild, organic scrubs can be used daily while chemically laced products should not be used more than twice a week.\n<h2>Step 3: Packing it on<\/h2>\nNow that you\u2019ve taken off all the unwanted things from your skin, it is time to pack some goodness in. A face pack or a sheet mask can be used for this purpose, depending on how much time you have. If you have oily skin, choose masks that have neem, turmeric, or activated charcoal for the best results. If you want to get rid of acne prone skin then this <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/korean-skin-care-routine-oily-skin\/\">step-by-step Korean Skin Care Routine for oily skin<\/a> can prove really helpful too. If you have dry skin, masks with aloe, honey, and vitamin E are the best for your skin. If you have combination skin, then you can focus on the issue you want to address first. For instance, if you have a lot of acne, you can pick a neem mask. If you want to get rid of tanning, a raw fruit mask should work.\n<h2>Step 4: Using a Toner<\/h2>\nToners help bring the pH balance of your skin back to normal and after using so many products, this I a step you cannot ignore. Add a few drops of toner to a cotton pad and wipe your face in circular motions. Some people use a toner before using a mask. If you use organic products, you can use the toner to clean residual dirt and your pores before applying the mask. However, if you are using chemically laced masks, use the toner afterward to restore your skin\u2019s pH levels.\n<h2>Step 5: Moisturize<\/h2>\nFinally, use a moisturizer of your choice so that your skin remains hydrated and soft while you sleep!\n\nFor more skin care tips, queries &amp; consultation, visit our <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">skin specialists in Gurgaon<\/a> today!","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Your Perfect Nighttime Skincare Routine Establishing a beauty routine for your skin can do wonders!
