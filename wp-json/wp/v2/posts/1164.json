Sure, you will only get the procedure done at a certified centre but do you know what questions that you must ask your dermatologist\/cosmetologist when you start the therapy with them?\n\nWe bring to you a list of questions that you should definitely consider asking your dermatologist before you start with the treatment. These questions will help you get a clearer idea about all the aspects related to the procedure and the clinician in general.\n\n<strong>1.) Are there risks associated with the procedure?<\/strong>\n\nThe first question that you need to ask the dermatologist before you start with laser hair removal is if there are any risks associated with the procedure. This will help you weed out the really overconfident clinicians.\n\nAs with any medical procedure, there is a certain amount of risk associated with laser hair removal as well. But ensuring that quality practices and time-tested protocols are used makes sure that the risk factor stays well within the\u00a0limit.\n\n<strong>2.) What is the line of treatment?<\/strong>\n\nSome skin and hair types need longer sittings and some need shorter but multiple sittings over an extended period of time. The treatment in itself is just one part of the process. Another part is the management of symptoms and side effects (if any). A good clinician will be able to help you with any skin irritation that may ensue, while a not so good clinician won&#8217;t.\n\nThe reason for this being that a good clinician takes years in the making. Studying and gaining a deeper understanding of the underlying causes of all side effects and is therefore better equipped academically to diagnose the cause of the problem and deliver suitable treatment.\n\n<strong>3.) Are there some precautions that you will need to take after?<\/strong>\n\nGetting laser hair removal done will require certain precautions that you need to take post procedure. Ask your clinician what precautions you need to take to get optimum, long-lasting results. These precautions also vary from person to person.\n\n<strong>4.) Ask if you are free to choose your appointments at your convenience?<\/strong>\n\nLife is busy. Make sure you ask your dermatologist if you can schedule appointments with them based on your convenience. Most clinics that offer cheap laser hair removal will not be able to accommodate your request as they are overwhelmed with patients. But a good clinician will always make time for you when you need them to.\n\nAt Garekars M.D Skin clinic, the best clinic for laser hair removal in Gurgaon, we believe that the ABC of a great practice is:\n\nA: Availability\nB: Behaviour\nC: Competence\n\n<strong>5.) Are they transparent and upfront with their rates?<\/strong>\n\nMost clinics that claim to have the cheapest rates in town will often have you incur additional and hidden costs, make sure that you ask upfront if the costs that are stated to you for your treatment are final and inclusive of all taxes, doing this can save you a lot of money.\n\nThe additional costs incurred at some of these \u201ccheap\u201d clinics can go up to 200% of the costs stated.\n\n<strong>6.) How long have they been at it?<\/strong>\n\nWhile the treatment may be minimally invasive, it should be clear to you by now that it is a procedure that can have side effects. This procedure is one that requires expertise and you will definitely get a better prognosis (outcome) when you get it done with an experienced clinician.\n\n<strong>7.) What technology do you use?<\/strong>\n\nBefore you leave for your appointment, look up some of the lasers that are commonly being used for laser hair removal today. This will give you a deeper insight about how your treatment is going to be carried out.\n\nThis article will clear things for you up a bit &#8211;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.healthcentre.org.uk\/laser-hair-removal\/lhr-types-machines.html\">http:\/\/www.healthcentre.org.uk\/laser-hair-removal\/lhr-types-machines.html<\/a>\n\n<strong>8.) Qualification of the people conducting the treatments?<\/strong>\n\nQualifications matter, you would never have someone who isn\u2019t a pilot fly the plane you are in. There are diplomas that validate a person to perform laser hair removal and other such procedures. What you must remember is that there is no way that you can trust a 6-month diploma the same way as you can trust years over years of medical training, it is to this effect that we suggest that you get laser hair removal done only with a board registered dermatologist.\n\nAt <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">Garekars M.D Skin Clinic<\/a>, you can rest assured that you will get the best treatment that is free from side effects, has a longer, better outcome and is the best laser hair removal treatment in DLF Phase 1, Gurgaon.\n\nWith us you get:\n\n1.)
