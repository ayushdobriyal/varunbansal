Where did it come from? Why is this even happening?\n\nYour mind is probably racing with these thoughts and more as you struggle to cover it up and look your best.\n\nBut, before you do so, calm down!\n\nDark spots are natural results of ageing (no, we are not calling you old), and they occur due to hyper-pigmentation, a by-product of sun exposure. They are not hazardous to your health, but yes, they are definitely hazardous to your self-esteem.\n\nLuckily for you, we know how to get rid of them! Keep reading to know more!\n<h2>Laser treatment<\/h2>\nLaser treatment is a cosmetic treatment provided by many leading dermatologists. While you may have heard of <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/laser-hair-removal\/\">laser treatment for hair removal<\/a>, there\u2019s a version of this treatment that\u2019s great for getting rid of dark spots (and acne scars too).\n\nOf course, this is a voluntary procedure so you must be sure you want to go through with it!\n\nSpeak to your dermatologist about side effects beforehand.\n<h2>Chemical peels<\/h2>\nTo be fair, chemical peels sound terrifying.\n\nIn this procedure, a dermatologist applies a chemical solution to the skin that makes it peel off so that new skin can take its place.\n\nIf you want to get this treatment done, just make sure that you\u2019re getting it done through a <a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/\">certified skin specialist<\/a>, and not through a random quack!\n\nA high dose of the chemicals can end up burning or scarring your skin for good!\n<h2>Microdermabrasion<\/h2>\nA powerful exfoliation technique, microdermabrasion is a popular treatment that you can avail from a dermatologist.\n\nIn this, a machine first sprays crystals onto your face, and then suctions them off to clean your face of all the dead skin cells.\n\nIt also helps boost your collagen production, which is great for women who want their skin to look radiant and youthful even in their 30s.\n<h2>Cryosurgery<\/h2>\nDon\u2019t be fooled by the word surgery \u2013 this is a non-invasive procedure!\n\nDuring this procedure, a dermatologist will spray liquid nitrogen onto the dark spots, and this will freeze the spots effectively. Once the spot freezes, it turns white.\n\nThe process of freezing may occur a few times, based on how stubborn the dark spots are. Once its done, the dark spots will form a scab, which will then peel off to reveal clean, gorgeous skin underneath!\n\nOf course, there\u2019s one caveat \u2013 you cannot pick or scratch the scab! Think of it as chickenpox for beauty!\n\nOf course you can also explore a few <a href=\"https:\/\/www.byrdie.com\/how-to-treat-dark-spots-4686898\">DIY treatments like using lemon<\/a> to lighten the dark spots, but do keep in mind that such treatments only work for very faint spots, and are not always permanent.\n\nTo get rid of your unsightly dark spots,\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/garekarsmdskinclinic.com\/contact-us\/\" rel=\"nofollow\" class=\"broken_link\">get in touch with us for an expert consultation<\/a>!","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>When you\u2019re getting ready to go out, nothing can ruin your mood (and your look) the way a random dark spot on the face can!
